We have already released 4 episodes of CSE Simplified to help you understand what CSE is all about and how to approach it. Many more episodes are yet to come. We hope they will help you get the most out of your B.Tech.

In this 5th episode, we want to talk about one of the most dangerous problem several students fall into. It's the **"FOMO - Fear Of Missing Out"**. Our aim is to clear out some points so that you can happily go through the journey of becoming a successful person.

Competition with your batch mates is normal. But it must be healthy. It should not constantly deviate you from your path. It is supposed to elevate you not demotivate you.

Some common reasons which make students feel FOMO are:

1. He is doing Web development, building apps

2. He is famous

3. He is earning thousands and lakhs

4. His GPA/rank is higher than me

5. He is a Student ambassador and has connections with companies

6. He roams daily with the person he loves

7. Teachers praise him

8. He does his assignments, projects etc. on time

9. He has a big friend circle

... And many more

[Same applies for females as well. Don't blame me for gender discrimination ðŸ˜œ]

But understand this :Â  Life me FOMO hamesha rahega. Tum koi Harry Potter ki Hermione nhi ho jo time travel kar ke har jagah pahuch jao or sab padh lo.

Human ka nature hai ki wo max to max information grab karna chata hai, usko lagta hai ki jitni information uske pass hogi wo utna hi Smart, Knowledgeable and superior hoga.

Jab ham kisi bade se koi doubt puchte hai to definalaty usko hamse jyda aata hai q ki uske pass hamse jyada KNOWLEDGE hai.

But **KNOWLEDGE** aati hai **INFORMATION + PRACTICE + EXPERIENCE** se.

Practice and Experience time consuming hai.

To log sidha information pe attack karte hai or unko lagta hai ki jitni information mere pass hogi mai utna hi Knowledgeable ban jaunga.

But that's not true although you all may think so.

Q ki information is the first step, so people just grab it and relax.

So, **key takeaway (1)** here is : *You have to practice and experience situations where that information is useful*.Â 

For example, aapne web development ka course kiya. To course kar k certificate le lena tumhare liye irrelevant hai. You have to implement what you have learnt to build something useful & helpful. Aur jaise hi tum 2-3 projects karoge, that is when the information you grabbed will transform into knowledge.Â 

Also Human ki ek habit hai Compare karna. Jo ki jaruri bhi hai taki wo dekh sake ki aaj wo kaha stand karta hai.

But ye comparison healthy hona chahiye or kudse hona chahiye.

Agar tum dusre ki success se dukhi hote ho to you are sick. And this sickness will never give you success. Agar ye successful people aapke field k hai, to learn from them. Adapt best practices and grow. Don't be selfish. They have spent much greater amount of productive time than you.Â 

**Key takeaway (2)** :  *Do what you love, Love what you do and change the "How you do it" based on healthy comparison.*

Jis bhi tech field k baare me aap sunte ho sabhi me scope hai, sath hi Competition bhi. Before making my point let me ask you, what do you mean by scope in first place?

Well, whichever tech field you see, it is solving some problem out there ; building great scalable product and making it profitable. So, till the time you feel like you can also make use of it and solve some problem it's GREAT! Now just think of a good business model and there you are - a budding entrepreneur : Your own boss. As simple as that. That's scope.

Aur jab baat aati hai koi framework pick karne ki like : Flutter vs Android Native. Then here comes your likes and dislikes. Because har framework market me aaya hi isliye hai taki wo grow kar sake. Maanaa ki kabhi band bhi ho sakta hai. But grab kari hui knowledge kabhi waste nahi hoti. Jo design patterns aap sikhoge, wapas use aa sakte ho.Â 

Here is a fact through which I would prove my point : Software engineer ka basic qualification hai - Competitive Programming. They never decide based on which framework you use unless you haven't built something using it.

And these big tech giants will never say to stick to a single framework or type of development. Once a project finishes, you can pick something new.Â 

**Key takeaway (3)** :  *Nothing is going anywhere. Pick whatever suits you. Learn, Build, Grow! So, picking a framework/Development is about likes and dislikes. Which IDE you like, which language you like, which design process you like, decide based on that. Not WILL THIS DEVELOPMENT VANISH? WILL MY TIME BE WASTED?*

**Key takeaway (4)** : *Ek baar jab aapne koi field pick kar liya to, try to stick to it for at least an year. Just focus on improving and growing in it rather than switching frequently.*

Maine kaha stick to that field for at least an year. Iska matlab ye nahi ki tum development k chakkar me CP aur Core CS compromise kar do us ek saal me. Na na na!

Jab aap kisi jagah hote ho to definalaty usi time pe aap kahi aur physically nhi ho sakte.

Usi tarike se jab aap mentally kisi ek jagah par hote hai to dusri jagah nhi ho skate.

Haan, Context switching kafi fast hai but only one thing at a time.

Means ki agar aap is time kuch soch rahe ho to definalaty aap dusri chiz miss karoge.

To ye to hamesa se hi raha hai ki agar aap ek chiz karoge to dusri miss hogi hi.

To solution kya hai? Solution hai slow motion multitasking. Maine pichle episodes me bhi discuss kiya hai, weekly ya monthly basis pe switching kar k CP, Core CS and Development equally experience karo. Make this very clear : switch karne ka matlab ye nahi ki ek mahina web development kar liya, ek mahina Android kar liya aur banaya to kuch hai hi nahi. Well, banana bhi only motive mat rakhna. Sikhna aur kitna jaldi aap concepts ko recall kar pate hai. That matters.

Wo to aap ek baar kuch bana k market me kudoge tab hi pta lagega. Ki ek baar me kuch chiz perfect nahi banti. There is always scope for improvement. So, accept it and keep improving on one type of Development rather than switching fields.

You can also focus on other skills like Blogging, Graphics Designing, Video Editing, Digital Marketing etc when you feel like taking a break but switching Development field frequently is a bad idea.

**Key takeaway (5)** :  *Bruce lee once said : **"I fear not the man who has practiced 10,000 kicks once, but I fear the man who has practiced one kick 10,000 times"**. So, do slow-motion multitasking and keep improving on one Development field. Because each field is too vast and constantly growing. So, definately it can't be covered in a month!*

To jab aap ek hi field pe focus karoge to dusre field k logo se comparison kar k dukhi hona murkhta hai.Â 

Jab app ek time par ek chiz hi soch skate ho ek jagah hi present rah skate ho to accordingly to tum ek time par jyda chize kese kar skate ho.

Jab ye possible hi nhi to tension kis baat ki? Aur agar tension lene ka shauk hai to koi solution bhi nahi hai!

Jis tarike se tum apni age nhi rok sakte, day & night ki cycle nahi rok sakte wese hi tum ek sath sari chize experience nhi kar skate.

Definalaty ek chiz karoge to dusri kahi saari chize miss hogi hi.

Ab Game bhi kelna hai, Future Jiwan sathi se ganto bate bhi karni hai, Development bhi sikhna hai, ML/AI se Iron man jaise F.R.I.D.A.Y bhi bana na hai, DSA me sabka Bap bhi banna hai, CSE ko tip par rkahna hai.

It sounds like, ek hi time me har jagah present hona.

Which is technically not possible.Â 

So, **key takeaway (6)** :  *Do multitasking between the trio (CP, CS, DVPT), focus on one field of dvpt and accept that you are going to miss other fields. That's the only way unless Hermione is your girlfriend ðŸ˜œ*.

Aah! That was a lot to cover in just one episode. But I hope I have shown you the path.Â 

FOMO is something we all experience but no one wants to talk about it. Well, I believe the picture is clearer now.

So, best of luck! Walk together in one direction and become the master of CSE.Â 

At last I would like to say .... Oh some other time (because I haven't read Shrimad Bhagwat Geeta else I would say a Shloka by JagatGuru Shree Krishna because I definately believe in some way he would have spoken about this. I still have a long way to go before reading Geeta!)

Thank you for your time and take care!
